## My process

I first focused on implementing structure and deign to both Selected and Unselected components and then implemented JavaScript to toggle between both states.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- This Project helped me in reinforcing my knowledge of JavaScript and also helped me in understanding how to work with hidden elements.It also helped me in understanding how to use event handlers in storing the user choice and display the required message to user.

- I also learned how to give background circle to numbers.

### Continued development

I am looking forward to improve my JavaScript skills and improve myself in making responsive websites.
